"# Scoundrel-Solitaire" 
Scoundrel is a solitaire type game where a player makes use of cards to go through rooms in a simulated dungeon.
By suit, spades and clubs represent monsters that a player must face, diamonds represent weapons that a player can use to aid them in battle and hearts represent potions that heal back the player.
Starting with a maximum of 20 health points one must carefully pick their moves in each room represented by 4 opened cards from the stack until only one card is left open thus moving to the next room and filling the three open spots until the final monster of the dungeon is defeated or the player reaches 0 health points.
full rules and how to play will be added in the future.
